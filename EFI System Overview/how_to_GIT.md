This is the quick guide to git using cmd in Linux through HTTPS server

1. Create a Repository on your Github account with a single README.md file or leave it blank. Your choices!

2. Copy the HTTPS link at the green-marked <>Code section 

3. $ git clone <https://github.com/Your_account_name/link_to_your_repository.git> it at ~/ or ~/Documents

4. $ cd to the true repository (dir) that now existed on your machine (in this case it was "link_to_your_respository" dir) and type in following commands

$ git add .

$ git commit -m "Initial commit"	// you can type whatever you want, personally, i want to update them, said "Bug fixed in model/src" 

$ git config --global user.email "youremail@xxxx.com"

5. If you don't have any Personal access tokens, create one and redo this again, good luck!
